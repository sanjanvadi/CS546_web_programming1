                    <p>
                        First of all, obviously "Halo: Combat Evolved".<br>
                        The first game, to have 1st person point of view,<br>
                        with awesome gameplay, story and graphics ahead of it's time.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Second favourite is "Assassins Creed" (al of em! 1 to 9)<br>
                        I just love stealth gameplays and the silent kills to be made.<br>
                        Requiescat in Pace (Rest in Peace), well i did learn something from this game.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Third would be, The Far Cry series (Far Cry 6 takes the cake though),<br>
                        Here, you can either be a silent assassin or an all out mass murderer.<br>
                        I made about 54000 kills in this game, so you don't wanna mess with me, lol JK.
