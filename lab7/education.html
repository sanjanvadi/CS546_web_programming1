                <h2>Chandarkant Patil English Medium School</h2>
                <p>History was my favourite class in this school, the past quiet well intriguied me.<br>
                    I was hooked on to history cause of my professor's storytelling skills.<br>
                    The way she would rekindle the past into our minds was very enlightning.</p>
                <aside>I still remember our school trip to Darjeeling,<br>
                    me and mates had a very good time enjoying the campfire and eating marshmellows.</aside>

                <h2>Gurukul Independent PU college</h2>
                <p>My favourite class at Gurukul was Microcontrollers.<br>
                professor would always start the class with his unique funny story,<br>
                which would catch our attention and explain the concepts in the most wonderful way.</p>
                <aside>The time when my professor lost a bet against me and my mates,<br>
                and he had to buy us all 1500rs worth of samosas.</aside>

                <h2>Basaveshwar Engineering College</h2>
                <p>Web Programming would definetily take the cake for being one of my favourite in undergrad.<br>
                I had so much fun going through the course and building lots of websites,<br>
                i used bootstrap to play around with the styling and got so much to learn.</p>
                <aside>I would never forget the time, when we went for a roadtrip to the mountains and ended up at the beach.<br>
